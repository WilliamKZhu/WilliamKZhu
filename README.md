### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is William Zhu and I'm am currently a new graduate seeking the opportunity to grow professionally. I was initially drawn towards the field of data analytics because analogy one of my mentors made. Data is similar to a large puzzle; the small pieces hold very little meaning by itself but once solved, it paints the bigger picture with more clarity. The solved puzzle can then be shared amonst friends so that everyone can enjoy the bigger picture. In this scenario, the individual puzzle pieces represent raw uncleaned data but once cleaned it reveals trends and patterns that is much easier to read and share. 

The purpose of this repository is to organize and show CIS / Data analytics projects I've done throughout my years in college to showcase potential employers. This repository may contain a mix of different programming languages such as Python, SQL, R.
