### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is William Zhu and I'm currently a senior at CUNY Baruch majoring in data analyst. I was drawn to this field because a data analyst's job is vital to any 
organization in making decisions to better aid customers. The purpose of this repository is to organize CIS / Data analytics notes I've done throughout college. 
This would include group projects, homeworks, class notes on Python, C++, SQL.
